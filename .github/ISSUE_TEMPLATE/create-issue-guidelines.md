# 🛠️ Issue Creation Guidelines for SSOC S4 — EdgeCareer

Hi PAs 👋,

To help contributors join **EdgeCareer** easily and start contributing effectively, please create issues in your projects and categorize them by difficulty:

- 🔰 **Beginner** — Good for newcomers to get started quickly  
- ⚙️ **Intermediate** — For contributors with some experience  
- 🚀 **Advanced** — For experienced contributors who want challenging tasks

### Please make sure to:

- Add one of the difficulty labels: `Beginner`, `Intermediate`, or `Advanced`  
- Always tag the issue with **`SSOC S4`** so contributors can easily find and get recognition for their contributions in Social Summer of Code Season 4  
- Provide a clear description of the task and expected outcome  
- Include any resources or references to help contributors get started

Let’s make it simple and welcoming for everyone to contribute from **14th June** onwards.

Thanks for your effort and happy coding! 💙
